# Data_Classification_ML
An interesting and logical ML Project that relates to Data Classification and Drawing Hypothesis. This is a big step to take before exploring much advanced topics of Supervised Learning!

A quick briefing of this assignment:
- Data Generation: We initiate by generating two random Datasets that are represented by '+' and '-'. We refer to them as positive and negative samples respectively.
- Defining Class Boundary: Class is a rectangular boundary assigned to this data by experts that separates the positive and negative samples in the optimal manner.
- Estimating Hypothesis (S and G): The main task was to draw two rectangular boundaries (hypothesis) labelled S and G. The S boundary tightly packs the positive examples in the middle, whereas the G boundary is close to the negative examples.

  Note: Both boundaries are obeying the law of separating two datasets at all times.
  
- Hypothesis Testing: After implementation, we consider additional two datasets for testing. We place the S and G boundaries on the test set and observe the percentages of samples in the following cases:
  (i) Positive points falling in S
  (ii) Negative points falling in S
  (iii) Positive points falling in G
  (iv) Negative points falling in G

The outcome of this python project showed outstanding results, as the estimated Hypothesis showed accurate results on every iteration!
